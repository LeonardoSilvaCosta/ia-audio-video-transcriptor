### 💻 About

This project utilizes the OPEN AI API to transcribe audio and video files. In addition to a verbatim transcription, the application uses CHAT GPT to generate a processed transcription that produces smoother content for the reader without, however, altering the true meaning of the transcribed content. The final product generated when running the application is an analysis file based on user input.
